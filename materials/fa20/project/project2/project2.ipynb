    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Friday, 11/13. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must complete 2 checkpoints. For checkpoint 1, you must complete the questions up until the end of Part 2, pass all public autograders, and submit them by 11:59pm on Friday 10/30. For checkpoint 2, you must complete the questions up until the end of Part 3, pass all public autograders, and submit them by 11:59pm on Friday 11/06.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. Your partner must be enrolled in the same lab as you are. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp19/staff.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",

    "All of the concepts necessary for this project are found in the textbook. If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section often will help clarify the concept.\n",

In medical studies, individuals are typically weighted by the *amount of time* that they enrolled in the study. A more convenient sampling unit is a **person-month at risk**, which is one month spent by a particular woman in one of the comparison groups, during which she might or might not suffer a heart attack. Here, \"at risk\" just means the woman is being tracked by the survey in either of the two comparison groups, so that if she had a heart attack it would be counted in our data set.\n",

    "To establish a causal link between saturated fat intake, serum cholesterol, and heart disease, a group of doctors in the US established the National Heart-Diet Study. The study was based in 6 centers: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Oakland, and Faribault, MN. The first 5 centers recruited volunteers from the local population: volunteers and their families were asked to adjust their diet to include more or less saturated fat.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may already have a strong intuition about what the doctors concluded in their findings, but the evidence from the trial was surprisingly complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth center was organized by Dr. Ivan Frantz, and its study was known as the Minnesota Coronary Experiment. Dr. Frantz was a strong proponent of reducing saturated fats to prevent death from heart disease. He believed so strongly in the idea that he placed his household on a strict diet very low in saturated fats. The main difference between the Minnesota Coronary Experiment and the rest of the National Diet-Heart Study was the setting. While the other centers in the study looked at volunteers, Dr. Frantz conducted his study at Faribault State Hospital, which housed patients who were institutionalized due to disabilities or mental illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this institution, the subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups: half of the subjects, the **control group**, were fed meals cooked with saturated fats, and the other half, the **diet group**, were fed meals cooked with polyunsaturated fats. For example, the diet group's oils were replaced with corn oils and their butter was replaced with margarine. The subjects did not know which food they were getting, to avoid any potential bias or placebo effect. This type of study is known as a **blind** study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although standards for informed consent in participation weren't as strict then as they are today, the study was described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*No consent forms were required because the study diets were considered to be acceptable as house diets and the testing was considered to contribute to better patient care.  Prior to beginning the diet phase, the project was explained and sample foods were served. Residents were given the opportunity to decline participation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the level of detail and effort in the study, the results of the study were never extensively examined until the late 21st century. Over 40 years after the data were collected, Dr. Christopher Ramsden heard about the experiment, and asked Dr. Frantz's son Robert to uncover the files in the Frantz family home's dusty basement. You can learn more about the story of how the data was recovered on the [Revisionist History podcast](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/20-the-basement-tapes) or in [Scientific American magazine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/records-found-in-dusty-basement-undermine-decades-of-dietary-advice/)."

If you're not sure, some areas of consideration may be the study organizers' selection of participants for the study, as well as their justification for not using consent forms.
