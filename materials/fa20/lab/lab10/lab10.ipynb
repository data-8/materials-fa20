Someone with cancer can receive a negative result.  (\"Positive\" means \"pointing toward cancer,\" so in this context it's bad!)  Doctors and patients often deal poorly with the first case, called *false positives*.  For example, a patient may receive dangerous treatment like chemotherapy or radiation despite having no cancer or, as happens more frequently, having a cancer that would not have impacted their health.\n",

    "# 4. Tree diagrams\n",
    "A tree diagram is another useful visualization that helps us calculate conditional probabilities.  It is easiest to draw a tree diagram when the probabilities are presented in a slightly different way - specifically, we first look at the probabilities of cancer in the entire population, and then examine the rates of positive test results within the cancer and no cancer groups.  For example, people often summarize the information in your `cancer` table using 3 numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The overall probability of having cancer is **`p_cancer`**.  (This is called the *base rate* or *marginal probability* of the disease.)\n",
    "2. Given that you have cancer, the probability of a positive test result is **`p_pos_given_cancer`**.  (This is called the *sensitivity* of the test.  Higher values of `p_pos_given_cancer` mean the test is more useful.)\n",
    "3. Given that you don't have cancer, the probability of a positive test result is **`p_pos_given_nocancer`**.  (This is called the *false positive rate* of the test.  Higher values of `p_pos_given_nocancer` mean the test is less useful.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You already saw that the base rate of cancer was .01 in the previous section.  `p_pos_given_cancer` and `p_pos_given_nocancer` can be computed using the same method you used to compute the conditional probability of cancer given a positive test result.\n",
