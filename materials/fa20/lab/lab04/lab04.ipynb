    "## 1. Defining functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a very simple function that converts a proportion to a percentage by multiplying it by 100.  For example, the value of `to_percentage(.5)` should be the number 50 (no percent sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition has a few parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `def`\n",
    "It always starts with `def` (short for **def**ine):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Name\n",
    "Next comes the name of the function.  Like other names we've defined, it can't start with a number or contain spaces. Let's call our function `to_percentage`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  This tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  A function can have any number of arguments (including 0!). \n",
    "\n",
    "`to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion)\n",
    "    \n",
    "If we want our function to take more than one argument, we add a comma between each argument name. Note that if we had zero arguments, we'd still place the parentheses () after that name. \n",
    "\n",
    "We put a **colon** after the signature to tell Python that the next indented lines are the body of the function. If you're getting a syntax error after defining a function, check to make sure you remembered the colon!\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation\n",
    "Functions can do complicated things, so you should write an explanation of what your function does.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing an **indented** triple-quoted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Body\n",
    "Now we start writing code that runs when the function is called.  This is called the *body* of the function and every line **must be indented with a tab**.  Any lines that are *not* indented and left-aligned with the def statement is considered outside the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes about the body of the function:\n",
    "- We can write code that we would write anywhere else.  \n",
    "- We use the arguments defined in the function signature. We can do this because we assume that when we call the function, values are already assigned to those arguments.\n",
    "- We generally avoid referencing variables defined *outside* the function. If you would like to reference variables outside of the function, pass them through as arguments!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's give a name to the number we multiply a proportion by to get a percentage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `return`\n",
    "The special instruction `return` is part of the function's body and tells Python to make the value of the function call equal to whatever comes right after `return`.  We want the value of `to_percentage(.5)` to be the proportion .5 times the factor 100, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "        return proportion * factor\n",
    "        \n",
    "`return` only makes sense in the context of a function, and **can never be used outside of a function**. `return` is always the last line of the function because Python stops executing the body of a function once it hits a `return` statement. If a function does not have a return statement, it will not return anything; if you expect a value back from the function, make sure to include a return statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:*  `return` inside a function tells Python what value the function evaluates to. However, there are other functions, like `print`, that have no `return` value. For example, `print` simply prints a certain value out to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "`return` and `print` are **very** different. "
