    "# Lab 1: Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Data 8: *Foundations of Data Science*!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly lab session is designed to develop your skills with computational and inferential concepts. These lab assignments are a required part of the course and will be released on Monday nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab sessions are not webcast! There are two ways to each full credit the weekly lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By completing the lab assignment and passing all tests by Wednesday at 8:59am (PST) for that week's lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. By attending your lab section, and being “checked-off” by the GSIs or a learning assistant via the Lab Queue. You will be given a secret word which you will then enter into the check-off form. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Lab 1, however, you are **required** to attend lab and be checked off. For all other labs you can follow one of the two methods listed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the Lab Queue at [lab.data8.org](https://lab.data8.org/). You can add yourself to the queue in order to get help from a GSI or learning assistant! This is also where you will be given the secret word for check-off. Please feel free to add yourself to the queue whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification -- we are more than happy to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask an instructor or classmate for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more of the [course policies](http://data8.org/fa20/policies.html) on the [course website](http://data8.org/fa20/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Today's lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and\n",
    "4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers parts of [Chapter 3](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html) of the online textbook. You should read the examples in the book, but not right now. Instead, let's get started!"
